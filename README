Grib2 plugin for OpenCPN
========================

Prerequisities
--------------
Jasper library has to be installed
Ubuntu Linux: sudo apt-get libjasper-dev
Other *nixes: Consult http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/

Windows notes:
- JasPer is not exactly dynamic linking ready...
- The Makefiles were deleted from the embedded version and jas_config.h was replaced with jas_config2.h and extended with "#define EXCLUDE_JPG_SUPPORT" to minimize the dependencies. 
- TODO: The embedded libjasper can and should be further stripped.

Compiling
=========
You have to be able to compile OpenCPN itself - Get the info at http://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual

* go to the plugin subdirectory in your OpenCPN source tree
* clone the plugin repository from github

Build as normally:

* cd ..
